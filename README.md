# Chrome Speak

The goal of this project is to help people with disabilities surf the internet using their voice. This can be implemented by pairing a chrome extension with a smart speaker (such as alexa or google home) which uses machine learning to help map user responses to the correct browser action they desire. If you join this project, you'll get to learn the ins and outs of how chrome extensions work and help make the internet more accessible. Examples of people who would benefit from this project: https://webaim.org/articles/motor/motordisabilities Note: If you speak other languages, we'd greatly appreciate your help in launching the extension in other countries. If alexa is used for the project, the skill can be used in the following countries at this time: https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/develop-skills-in-multiple-languages.html
